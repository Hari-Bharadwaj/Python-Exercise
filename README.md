# Python-Exercise
Programs I've written in a process to learn Python. 
Most of them are from Automate the Boring Stuff with Python By Al Sweigart. It's a must read for beginners.
You can find it here. https://automatetheboringstuff.com

I hope these not only acts as an indicator of my progress but also as educational reference for anyone who intends to start in python.
